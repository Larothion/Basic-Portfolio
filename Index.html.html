<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Taylor Harvey and I have a passion for Business, Esports, and the world of Coding. I graduated from the University of Central Florida in December of 2015 with a degree in Finance and right out of the gate started my own marketing business in the Esports industry.  Over the past year I have learned a wealth of information about sales, finding and mainting client relationships, influencer marketing, CRM, and networking within an everchanging environment.  Now, going into 2017, I have started Ucf's Code Bootcamp to not only further my education, but to add to the value proposition I bring along to my business as well as future clients. Feel free to take a look around! </p>
